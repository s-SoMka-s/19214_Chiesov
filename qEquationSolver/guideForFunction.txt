--------qSolver func---------
This function processes the following input:
 - solver (a, b, c) //solver (1, 0.5, 2)
"a", "b", "c" aruments can be either integers or float-values. 
The answer will always be a couple of float-values, 
but when the discriminant of the equation is less than zero,
a corresponding message about the lack of roots is displayed.
Wherein "a" argument can be either "0" or non "0". In this case,
the pair of roots consists of the same numbers,
as in the case when the discriminate is zero.
